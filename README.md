# MusicGen

MusicGen is a project designed to generate background music for children's books based on the tone and sentiment of the text. By using sentiment analysis, MusicGen creates an immersive auditory experience tailored to the emotional context of the story.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the emotional tone of the book's text to determine the sentiment (e.g., happy, sad, suspenseful).
- **Music Generation**: Dynamically generates background music tracks that align with the identified sentiment.
- **Adaptive Playback**: Music transitions smoothly between scenes, adapting to changes in tone and sentiment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface for uploading book text and customizing music preferences.
